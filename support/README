These were entirely complete and independent systems that were brought into the
engine codebase to make packaging, evolution, debugging, and maintenance of the
engine easier. It was too difficult to git bisect or deal with the separate
repos continual movement between servers, etc, etc. This fundamentally forks
them from their original repos and without the previous history. Each directory
contains a license file.

We identify the sources and SHAs of the provenance of these systems. Due to the
internet being what it is, there is no guarantee any of these links will be
valid in the future.
