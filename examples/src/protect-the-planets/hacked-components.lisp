;; NOTE: This file is here because I need draw order to work for PtP but the V
;; engine doesn't yet have a proper system for representing sorting of
;; rendering components. So, these two components take the place of the
;; rendering component in PtP. They will be removed and this hackish solution
;; deleted when rendering components can properly sort. This method is also
;; crappy and not intended for default behavior in V. It is too nasty to use.
;; The code duplication alone is vomitous.

;; NOTE: I should be able to specify these components in the typedag, but
;; that functionality seems terribly broken right now.
